Simple portfolio is a web application written in Python that allows users to track their investments in the stock market. Users can send order to the broker to buy or sell stocks, view their portfolio details and see the performance of their investments.

The users can see their potfolio performance over time or see the performance of individual stocks for both in local currency and USD.

By default the application uses the Algolab API from DenizBank for BIST but you can easily change the API to use any other API.
